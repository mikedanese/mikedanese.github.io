title: Turing Equivalent Models (Part 1)
author: Mike Danese
---
  

{{page.indent}}This is a first of a series of posts examining Turing equivalent computational models. We will first introduce the Turing machine. Later we will examine register machines, such as the random access machine, in the context of Turing equivalence. Later we will examine lambda calculus and Markov algorithms. Finaly we will procced cyclic tag systems and Rule 110.

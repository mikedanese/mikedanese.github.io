title: Turing Equivalent Models (Part 1)
author: Mike Danese
---
  

{{page.indent}}This is a first of a series of posts examining Turing equivalent computational models. We will first introduce the Turing machine. Then we will examine the random access machine and other register machines in the context of Turing equivalence. Later we will examine lambda calculus and Markov algorithms. Finally we will procced to cyclic tag systems and Rule 110.

I was recently reviewing some topics of Zermeloâ€“Fraenkel Set Theory and I stumbeled upon an experpt discussing some short comings of Cantor's early naive set theory particularly regarding [Russell's famous paradox](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell's_paradox). The formal definition is as follows:


{% raw %}
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
  \text{Let } R = \{ x \mid x \not \in x \} \text{, then } R \in R \iff R \not \in R
</script>
{% endraw %}

We will dive into this further after reviewing two of the earliest and most basic axioms of ZF set theory and we will discover that this is not a paradox after all.
